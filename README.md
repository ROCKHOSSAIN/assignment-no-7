b- managing the state in your assignment project
 I would likely have a data structure that holds information about courses. This could be an array, a list, or a more complex data structure, depending on the complexity of my project.When the application starts, the state is initialized. This might involve loading data from a database, a file, or some other source. Each course's information, including its name, price, and credit hours, would be stored in the state. selecting a course, changing its price, or updating its credit hours. When these interactions occur, the state needs to be updated to reflect these changes.
 Overall, managing the state in my course-selling project involves keeping track of course-related data (name, price, credit hours) and ensuring that this data is updated and reflected accurately in the user interface as users interact with the application
